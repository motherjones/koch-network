Kochtopus meeting

what do we want to show?

everything? including groups that they more of less control + other think tanks they've funded over the years? Universities that Charles has funded?

part of value add is the more complete it is the more it's really unique and bragworthy, tempered by whether that can be done in a way that's intelligible. if there are groups/types that we can set aside 

not everything has to be shown the first glance view

e.g.
election year organizations + outer rings of 
galaxy metaphor


CJ: do we want it to move or do we want it to be flat?

TR/CJ: Why not a list?

MB: interesting thing is that it's hundreds of possible entries.

inner and outer orbits issue 

TR:sheer number of elements, types of elements and variety there, what's the third?

Chronology is another interesting layer


Narrower slices we can pull here:
University chairs have the Kochs funded?

Onus on getting this up and out well before the midterms. Well before October. Adding the pulling 990s to that is different beast.

Relationships between them -- we need to decide what do we mean by that. Koch funded or orchestrated? Or hard connection?

user would see koch's also give to wide variety of universities, funding chairs, and here's a list (within the list)

	type of org - dozen?
	org - less than 100
	person - not as many as orgs

koch universe permeates the entirety of modern conservative politics in a way that no other entity has done

all the candidates they've supported
all the univeristy presidents they've funded

how big is the koch universe? let's take you on a journey?

let's start with PACs... and so on


PLAN

Start with list Dan's already made. Comprehensive view and who should be named.

	org
	category
	blurb
	connection to koch
	people
	other orgs connected
	
Dan: taxonomy for existing list and for any notable ones not currently in list.
